## Overview

This project is a playground for me to learn and explore Apache Arrow with executable code and my own verbose in-line
comments and notes.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and run the example program.

1. Use Java 17
2. Build and run the example program
   * ```shell
     ./gradlew run
     ```
   * The program output will look something like this:
   * ```text
     [main] INFO dgroomes.Runner - Let's learn about Apache Arrow!
     [main] INFO org.apache.arrow.memory.BaseAllocator - Debug mode disabled.
     [main] INFO org.apache.arrow.memory.DefaultAllocationManagerOption - allocation manager type not specified, using netty as the default type
     [main] INFO org.apache.arrow.memory.CheckAllocator - Using DefaultAllocationManager at memory-netty/10.0.1/8975307e2967474540cbc8080869767000aee1f7/arrow-memory-netty-10.0.1.jar!/org/apache/arrow/memory/DefaultAllocationManagerFactory.class
     [main] INFO dgroomes.Runner - ZIP code vector: [90210, 19106, 82190]
     [main] INFO dgroomes.Runner - Population vector: [20700, 7043, 443]
     ```


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Model ZIP code data in a small hardcoded vector. I like using ZIP code data to explore data products, like I do in
  [my other projects](https://github.com/dgroomes/cypher-playground#overview)
* [ ] Sort the vector by population and query (binary search) for ZIP codes with a population in a given range. 
* [ ] Incorporate a full copy of ZIP code data. 
* [ ] Do something with a dictionary. Can I use a dictionary, keyed on the state codes?
* [ ] (stretch goal) Model cyclic graphs in the data using the ["state adjacencies" of my cypher-playground](https://github.com/dgroomes/cypher-playground/blob/dc836b1ac934175394ece264c443bfae47465cd6/postgres-init/2-init-states-data.sql#L1)
  and do a query by something like "find states adjacent to states that have at least a ZIP code with a population of 1,000,000"
  (or a more illustrative query if you can think of one)
* [ ] (stretch goal) Create a generic graph API plus a (overtly simple) query execution engine. The graph API only
  supports schema-ful graphs (does this matter?). The query execution engine should prune the vector lists (i can't find
  words for this right now).

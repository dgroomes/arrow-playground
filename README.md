## Overview

This project is a playground for me to learn and explore Apache Arrow with executable code and my own verbose in-line
comments and notes.


## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:


### `basic/`

A runnable "hello world" program featuring Apache Arrow.

See the README in [basic/](basic/).


### `sort-and-search/`

Sorting and searching vectors with Apache Arrow.

See the README in [sort-and-search/](sort-and-search/).


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Model ZIP code data in a small hardcoded vector. I like using ZIP code data to explore data products, like I do in
  [my other projects](https://github.com/dgroomes/cypher-playground#overview)
* [x] DONE Split into subprojects
* [x] DONE Incorporate a full copy of ZIP code data.
